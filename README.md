# Human_Emotion_Recognition
A state-of-the-art model for Real-Time Human Emotion Recognition

Facial image analysis has been a topic of intensive research in computer vision, image processing, and related fields as it is useful in several applications, like biometric identification, visual surveillance, human-machine interaction, video conferencing, content-based image retrieval and many other.

I have here implemented a state-of-the-art model for real-time human emotion recognition. The model has been trained and validated on the [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/astraszab/facial-expression-dataset-image-folders-fer2013).

This model can distinguish among seven emotions: happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust, fear, and neutral, based on facial expressions.

# To use
Clone the repository using command: git clone https://github.com/PreetiSajjan/Human_Emotion_Recognition.git

The dataset used is not included in the repository so need to be downloaded explicitly (link provided).

Train the model to detect mask using python emotion_detector.py

To run the test: python camera.py
